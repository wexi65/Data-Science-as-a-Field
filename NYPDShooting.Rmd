```{r NYPDShooting}
url_in <- "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/833y-fsy8/rows.csv"
NYPDShooting <- read_csv(url_in)
shooting <- NYPDShooting %>%
  mutate(OCCUR_DATE = mdy(OCCUR_DATE)) %>%
  select(-c(JURISDICTION_CODE, LOCATION_DESC, X_COORD_CD, Y_COORD_CD, Latitude, Longitude, Lon_Lat))

```{r Replace NA with UNKNOWN}

shooting$PERP_SEX <- shooting$PERP_SEX %>% replace_na("U")
shooting$PERP_RACE <- shooting$PERP_RACE %>% replace_na("UNKNOWN")
```
Since there are missing data for the perpetrators, so I just replace them with unknown.

```{r processing}

```

This plot illustrates shooting incidents across the entirety of New York. It demonstrates an initial gradual decline trend until around January 2020, followed by a sharp and significant upward trend thereafter.

```{r visualizing and analyzing shooting in Queens}
shooting_queens_year_total <- shooting_by_boro %>%
  filter(BORO == "QUEENS") %>%
  group_by(MONTH_YEAR) %>%
  summarize(INCIDENTS = sum(INCIDENTS)) %>%
  select(MONTH_YEAR, INCIDENTS) %>%
  ungroup()

shooting_queens_year_total %>%

  ggplot(aes(x = MONTH_YEAR, y = INCIDENTS)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = "INCIDENTS")) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  labs(title = "Shooting in Queens", y = NULL)
```

This plot depicts shooting incidents specifically within the Queens borough. It showcases a comparable trend to that of the entire New York, characterized by a decrease preceding January 2020, followed by a subsequent increase.

```{r visualizing and analyzing shooting in Manhattan}
shooting_manhattan_year_total <- shooting_by_boro %>%
  filter(BORO == "MANHATTAN") %>%
  group_by(MONTH_YEAR) %>%
  summarize(INCIDENTS = sum(INCIDENTS)) %>%
  select(MONTH_YEAR, INCIDENTS) %>%
  ungroup()
summary(shooting_manhattan_year_total)
shooting_manhattan_year_total %>%
  filter(INCIDENTS > 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = MONTH_YEAR, y = INCIDENTS)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = "INCIDENTS")) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  labs(title = "Shooting in Manhattan", y = NULL)
```

This plot visualizes shooting incidents within the Manhattan borough. Its trend closely mirrors that of the Queens borough. However, the accompanying summary reveals a difference in incident count, indicating fewer occurrences in comparison to Queens.

```{r modeling}
mod <- lm(INCIDENTS ~ MONTH_YEAR, data = shooting_year_total)
x_grid <- seq(as.yearmon("JAN 2006"), as.yearmon("DEC 2023"))
new_df <- tibble(MONTH_YEAR = x_grid)
shooting_year_total_pred <- shooting_year_total %>% mutate(pred = predict(mod))
shooting_year_total_pred %>% ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = MONTH_YEAR, y = INCIDENTS), color = "blue") +
  geom_point(aes(x = MONTH_YEAR, y = pred), color = "red")

```

When analyzing the data as a whole or by borough, a noticeable spike emerges around January 2020. However, predictions from a linear model indicate a declining trend due to the drops before this point. The presence of the pandemic might have influenced shooting incident numbers, introducing potential bias to the data.
